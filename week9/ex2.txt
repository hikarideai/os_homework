The aging algoritm exploits temporal locality. If the page was referenced a bit ago then there is a high probability that it will be referenced again very soon. Thus, if the list of page references contains a lot of repeating numbers, the hit ratio will increase. Likewise, if the list contains numbers that are almost unique or are spread out too much, the algorithm will degenerate.
